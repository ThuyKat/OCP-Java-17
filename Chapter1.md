# Java Building Blocks - Study Notes

Object in java is an instance of a class, methods are functions inside class and fields are variable inside class. Variables have 3 type: static one inside class which is shared by all instances we call it class variable, non-static one inside class but outside method. We call it instance variable because each instance has a copy of it. Variables inside methods (including parameters passed to functions/constructors and those declared inside) we call local variables. They're local because they exist inside function/constructors only and once the function/constructor completes they're removed by stack management. GC collects objects when instances become unreachable, or program ends. On the data side, we have 8 types of primitive data, when assigned a value will stay on the stack side which is different to reference type of data (object) being stored on the heap side and got collected by garbage collector. We call reference because whenever we assign it to a variable, we pass the address located on the heap and not the actual object. Note that GC only collects unused objects on the heap while stack management handles the stack side. GC is an advantage of Java compared to C++ so it has better memory management, platform independence due to the compiler can convert java into bytecode which is understood by JVM and able to run independently regardless of OS.

## üèóÔ∏è Java Building Blocks

**Java building blocks are classes/interfaces** (interfaces covered in chapter 5)

- **Object**: A runtime instance of a class
- All objects of all different classes represent the state of a program

### Components of a Class

1. **Methods** ‚Üí functions
2. **Fields** ‚Üí variables

**Keywords**: `class`, `public`, `void`, `parameters`

**Method signature**: Full declaration includes:
- Return type
- Parameters  
- Method's name
- Access modifier

---

## üöÄ Main Method

**main() method**: Gateway between startup of Java process and programmer's code.

### Compilation and Execution
```bash
javac file.java  # Compile
java file        # Run
```

---

## üì¶ Packages and Imports

- **Import statement**: Tells Java which packages to look for a class
- **java.lang**: Special package that's automatically imported
- **Packages**: Allow us to use the same name for different classes

### Naming Conflicts
Example: `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Date`

When both are required in code, use **fully qualified class name**:
```java
java.util.Date myDate = new java.util.Date();
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Constructors

- **Purpose**: Initialize fields
- **No return type**
- **Execution order**: Fields and instance initializer blocks run first, then constructor

### Execution Order Example

```java
public class Chick {
    // Step 1: Field initialization
    private String name = "Fluffy";

    // Step 2: Instance initializer block  
    { System.out.println("setting field"); } 

    // Step 3: Constructor execution
    public Chick() {
        name = "Tiny";
        System.out.println("setting constructor"); 
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        Chick chick = new Chick();
        System.out.println(chick.name); 
    } 
}
```

**OUTPUT**:
```
setting field
setting constructor
Tiny
```

**Rule**: 
1. Fields and instance initializer blocks run in the order they appear in the file
2. Constructor runs after all fields and instance initializer blocks

---

## üìä Data Types

### Primitive Types (8 types)
- Recognize valid values that can be assigned to numbers
- Stored on the stack

### Reference Types
- Can be assigned `null` (variable not referring to any object)
- When not null, can be used to call methods
- Stored on the heap

### Variable Declaration
- Can declare many variables in same declaration if they're all the same type
```java
int a, b, c;  // Valid
int x, String y;  // Invalid - different types
```

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Naming Conventions

### Identifier Rules
- **Method and variable names**: Begin with lowercase letter followed by CamelCase
- **Class names**: Begin with uppercase letter followed by CamelCase
- **Don't start with $**: Compiler uses this symbol for some files
- **Allowed characters**: A-Za-z0-9_$
- **0-9 cannot be first character**

---

## üìÅ File Structure

**Multiple classes can be defined in the same file**, but:
- Only **one** can be `public`
- Public class name **must match** the filename

---

## üóëÔ∏è Garbage Collection

**Process**: Automatically freeing memory on the **HEAP** by deleting objects no longer reachable

### Triggering Garbage Collection
- `System.gc()` suggests Java to run GC, but **Java can ignore it**
- GC typically runs when:
  1. Heap memory is full or nearly full
  2. JVM decides it's optimal time based on algorithms

### Objects Become Candidates for GC
1. **No references pointing to it**: Object sits on heap without accessible name
2. **All references gone out of scope**:
   - **Local variable**: When method ends
   - **Class variable**: Till end of program or class unloaded
   - **Instance variable**: When containing object becomes unreachable

### Important Notes
- GC is concerned with **objects on heap**, not **primitive values on stack**
- `System.gc()` does not directly collect primitive values
- When primitive variable goes out of scope, memory auto-reclaimed via stack management

---

## üéØ Variable Scope

### 1. Class Variable
- **Static variable** outside method, inside a class

### 2. Local Variable  
- Variable inside a method or passed as argument
- **No default values** - must be explicitly initialized

### 3. Instance Variable
- **Non-static variable** outside method, inside a class
Example:
```java
    public class Student {
    // CLASS VARIABLE (static) - shared by ALL students
    static int totalStudents = 0;
    
    // INSTANCE VARIABLES (non-static) - each student has their own
    String name;
    int age;
    
    public Student(String studentName) {
        // LOCAL VARIABLE (inside method)
        int currentYear = 2025;
        
        // Assigning to instance variable
        this.name = studentName;
        totalStudents++;  // Modifying class variable
    }
    
    public void study(int hours) {  // 'hours' is LOCAL VARIABLE (parameter)
        int focusLevel = 8;  // LOCAL VARIABLE
    }
}
```
---

## üîÑ var Identifier

**Local variable type inference** - compiler infers the type

### Rules
- **Only for local variables**
- **Cannot reassign to different type** (unlike JavaScript)
- **Not a keyword** - can be used as identifier
- **Reserved type name** - cannot define class, interface, or enum named `var`

### Restrictions
```java
// ‚ùå Cannot be used in multiple variable declaration
var a = 5, b = 10;  // DOES NOT COMPILE

// ‚ùå Must assign value on declaration line  
var x;  // DOES NOT COMPILE

// ‚ùå Cannot assign null without type context
var y = null;  // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

---

## üìù Text Blocks

**Multiple line string** - no need for `\"` or `\n`

### Syntax
```java
String textBlock = """
    This is a 
    text block
    """;
```

### Whitespace Types
- **Incidental whitespace**: Extra formatting spaces/tabs - auto removed
- **Essential whitespace**: Part of content - preserved

### Important Rules

#### ‚ùå Line Break Required
```java
String block = """doe"""; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

#### ‚úÖ Line Joining with Backslash
```java
String text = """
    Line 1 \
    Line 2
    """;
// Results in: "Line 1 Line 2"
```

#### Closing Position Affects Output
```java
// Closing """ on separate line adds extra blank line
String withBlankLine = """
    Content
    """;

// Closing """ on same line as content - no extra line  
String noBlankLine = """
    Content""";
```

### Text Block Features
- `formatted()` method works with text blocks (like `String.format()`)
- Produces `java.lang.String` objects
- All regular String methods applicable
- Line breaks are part of string content (`\n` included in length)

## üåü Java Characteristics

### Object-Oriented
- All code defined in classes
- Accessed via instantiation of class objects

### Platform Independence
- Code compiled once
- Possible to write code that doesn't run everywhere

### Compared to C++
- **More secure**: Runs inside JVM
- **No operator overloading**
- **Better memory management**: Auto garbage collector
